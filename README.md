# Python-Website-Blocker

# Overview
This project is a website blocker build using python. This script will help its users to filter out the website that they don't want to access. The app once executed will ask users to accept if they want to enable the filtering mode and once accepting the prompt(Y/y or N/n), default content filtering will be enabled till the user wants to disable it. User can any time press cancel on app and the filtering will be automatically removed. If no filtering is required at any given point in time then the execution of script can be avoided.
The project also mantains a list of URLs/Domains in a separate file that the user wants to block by enabling filtering mode. This simple text file can be updated anytime and script will automatically fetch the details from the file and filter the websites provided.
